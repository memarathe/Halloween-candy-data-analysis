improve readability and reduce memory usage. This was done by creating a dictionary mapping the old column names to new names and using the rename() function in pandas.\n\n- **Handling Missing Values**: Missing values were handled by dropping rows with missing data using the dropna() function. This was done for columns such as 'gender' and 'candy_rating'. Additionally, null values in the 'address' column were dropped as they were small in number.\n\n- **Data Normalization**: The 'Country' column had multiple representations of the same country name. Regular expressions were used to standardize these representations to a uniform notation. This was done by creating patterns to match variations of country names and applying a mapping function using the apply() function in pandas.\n\n- **Column Dropping**: Columns with a large number of null values or columns that were not critical for analysis were dropped. This was done using methods such as dropping columns with more than 50% null values and dropping columns that were not relevant for the analysis.\n\n- **Exporting Cleaned Dataset**: Finally, the cleaned dataset was exported to a new CSV file using the to_csv() function in pandas for further analysis.\n\n**Overall, in the cleaning process I successfully prepared the dataset for analysis by addressing missing values, standardizing data representations, and removing irrelevant columns. The cleaning methods used were effective in improving the quality and usability of the dataset for analysis. Methods like, replace(), fillna(),dropna(),unique(),isna(),isnull(),isnumeric(),value_counts(),etc...**\n\n**The reason for the specific cleaning strategies used is tasks is being written above before perforimg the tasks and is written inbetween code cells.**\n\n**Inorder to capture the performance of the data cleaning process we can plot a graph and comment on the
